## What does TG do?

TG allows you to use the terminal sort of like a normal graphical window.
If you are familiar with curses, the Linux library, TG does the same thing,
but for both Windows and Linux, and with a simplified flow. In fact,
the Linux version uses ncurses.

You can:

* Double-buffer the screen (for fast drawing)
* Collect input in a standard way
* Draw to the screen
* Use colors
